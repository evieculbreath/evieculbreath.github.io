    <p> During the 12th century, what you could call the bare bones of soccer was being played in the meadows of England. This early version was called Folkball,and while it barely resembles the modern sport, as it involved punching the ball with your fist and violently tackling the opposing team, it did focus on kicking. But the game was far too violent.</p>
    <p> It wasnt until the 1800s after the British government had banned it for centuries, that it was re-established as a winter sport with much safer rules. The game was played between English public schools like Eton, Winchester, and Charterhouse. The only problem was that each school had its own rules. Some allowed the limited carrying of the ball, like rugby, while others didnt allow players to touch it.</p>
